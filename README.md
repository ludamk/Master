# Master Thesis Code

This repository contains code developed as part of my Master’s thesis:
**Discrete Wildfires (Modeled Using Dijkstra's Algorithm and Finsler Geometry).**

It is recommended to review the scripts in the following order:
1. RiemannianFirePlanar.py
2. RiemannianFireGaussian.py
3. FinslerFire.py and FinslerFireGeodesics.py
4. SnellsLaw.py

The remaining scripts consist of supporting classes and helper functions.

Please note that the code in "adaptiveHexagonMesh.py" is from  
*A Concise Representation for Adaptive Hexagonal Meshes* by Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo.  
Minor modifications and additional code snippets have been added by Lucas Damkvist.
